### A short description:
Bomberman is a game in which you have to "destroy" your enemy with a bomb. These bombs 
are exploding after a few seconds. When the bomb explodes the player that is surrounded by
its blasting radius will lose a point of health.
The game takes place on a square board with randomly generated objects called
(obstacles). Behind these objects our enemy can hide,
so that he couldn't be "destroyed" by the bomb.
